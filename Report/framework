\subsection{Preprocessing}
We preprocess the data to make processing more meaningful \cite{weber2013finding}.
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Filtering} Removal of markup, punctuation and special characters from sentences.
\item\textbf{Tokenization} Splitting of text into individual units.
\item\textbf{Stemming} Reduction of words to their base forms \cite{porter1980algorithm}.
\item\textbf{Stopwords removal} Deletion of words that do not convey any special meaning.
\item\textbf{Pruning} Removal of words that do appear with a low frequency throughout the text.
\end{itemize}
The result of these preprocessing steps is a set of feature words.
\subsection{Text Understanding}
\cite{zhang2015character} \cite{zhang2015text} \cite{lecun1998gradient}.
\subsection{Clustering}
\cite{weber2013finding} \cite{zhu2014finding}.
\subsection{Popularity Prediction}
\cite{bandari2012pulse}.
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Age} The date of publication of news given by the dataset. We remove few records with missing dates.
\item\textbf{Text Quality} The ratio of size of document before and after preprocessing.
\item\textbf{Source Quality} The popularity of source of the content given by initial number of hits provided by the source. If missing, we use the popularity of news agent as a whole. This is log-normalized to account for high range of hits.
\item\textbf{Subjectivity} The ratio of size of document before and after preprocessing.
\item\textbf{Named Entities} The ratio of size of document before and after preprocessing.
\item\textbf{Factual Density} The ratio of size of document before and after preprocessing \cite{Lex:2012:MQW:2184305.2184308}.
\end{itemize}
