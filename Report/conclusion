\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we improve the quality of news cache and recommendations by predicting popularity of articles prior to publishing. The need for the same arises from the stiff competition among different news agencies and aggregators. Through deep convolutional neural networks, we extract features of articles at character-level. To remove redundant information, we make highly specific clusters of news items. Finally, we predict the most popular pieces in differnt clusters to provide the set of most popular articles, which is then used for multiple use-cases in content caching, advertising, forecasting and recommendation. With an initial survey, we ensure inceptive results of the pipeline versus different competitors. Lastly, we compare with different baselines to ascertain quality of our work.
