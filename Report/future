\section{Future Work}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Information explosion is prevalent not only in news items, but across different content classes. There rises the opportunity to extend the current work for multiple classes.
\item There are abundant works \cite{szabo2010predicting} \cite{Tatar:2011:PPO:1988688.1988766} which when given initial popularity of some content, are better able to forecast popularity. With that notion, we want to adapt the predictions to incoming hits.
\item With growing amount of personalization in different news agents \cite{Ilievski:2013:PNR:2516641.2516644} \cite{bao2013georank}, there exists a demand and an opportunity for the same in this work. 
\end{enumerate}
