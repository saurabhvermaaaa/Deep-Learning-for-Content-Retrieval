Delhi: Protesting Tamil Nadu farmers up the ante, cut mangalsutras
The protesting farmers put on an act where in they sang funeral songs and screamed out to the Prime Minister to come pay their grieving women a visit and take note of their plight.
For the last 33 days, the farmers from drought-hit Tamil Nadu have been protesting in the national capital. After rolling naked on the floor before the Prime Minister's office, to mock funerals and eating off the roads, the protesters today paraded on Jantar Mantar in sarees.
The farmers wore the mangalsutras around their necks which is actually a holy thread symbolising marriage.
The protesting farmers put on an act where in they sang funeral songs and screamed out to the Prime Minister to come pay their grieving women a visit and take note of their plight. The act was complete as a farmer took out a knife and went around cutting the mangalsutras off the protesters' necks as they beat their chests and grieved.
"This entire demonstration symbolises the plight of our women. Every farmer who commits suicide leaves behind a widow and the central government should take note of this and do the needful", said farmer leader Ayyakkannu.
A delegation led by CPI MP D Raja also reached Jantar Mantar to assure the farmers of stern action and pressurising the government. "Both centre and state remain silent on the issue. The centre even sent a team to assess the situation in Tamil Nadu but they still refuse to release adequate funds", said Raja.
The farmers remain adamant that until they meet the Prime Minister, until lands under nationalised banks are waived off and until a Cauvery water management board is set up, there is no going back to Tamil Nadu for them.
