PM Narendra Modi to shun red beacon in government's big crackdown on VVIP culture
The cabinet today took a decision disallowing Union ministers and top bureaucrats from using red beacons. According to sources, PM Modi will himself give up the 'laal batti'.

The Centre today took a decision against using red beacons. The decision, likely to be implemented from May 1, was cleared by the cabinet today and would impact Union minsters and top bureaucrats.
According to sources, only five categories of people will be allowed to use red beacons: the President of India, the Vice President, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Lok Sabha speaker.
While the prime minister would be allowed to use red beacons, sources tell India Today that PM Narendra Modi will himself give up the privilege to use it.
Commenting on the decision, Union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari said that beacons would be allowed only on emergency vehicles. Gadkari also said he would not be using a 'laal batti' on his vehicles.
Recently, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had instituted a similar ban on red and blue beacons in the state.
The new Congress government in the state has announced that using red or any type of beacon in Punjab will be criminal offense , but hasn't clarified whether judges of the state courts will be required to follow the new directive.  
The Bharatiya Janata Party's Yogi Adityanath, who completed a month as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister today, has also warned his ministers and bureacrats not to misuse red beacons. "
I acknowledge that the MLAs and ministers of the state are in charge of a huge population of Uttar Pradesh and thus entitled to a few privileges but they are to use these privileges with caution," he had said in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.
