Gundagardi hai bus: Singer Sonu Nigam slams use of loudspeakers at religious places
The Indian Twitterati woke up to singer Sonu Nigam's comment against the Azaan call given by a mosque near his home. He is getting slammed for calling the practice 'gundagardi'.

Twitterati is having an active Monday morning, all thanks to singer Sonu Nigam who shared how he was forced to wake up early because of the sound of morning Azaan from a local mosque.
Azaan is a call to prayer given five times a day by the muezzin of a mosque. The first call is given early in the morning.
Calling it 'forced religiousness', he tweeted he is not a Muslim and still wakes up by the Azaan in the morning.

Sonu Nigam also criticised the use of loudspeakers in temple and gurudwara. "I don't believe in any temple or gurudwara using electricity To wake up people who don't follow the religion . Why then..? Honest? True?" [sic], he tweeted.
Azaan is an Islamic call to worship and is given five times a day by the muezzin of a mosque.
Twitter users, outraged by his comments, are slamming Sonu Nigam on the social networking.
If only there was a way to rate Sonu Nigam 1 star on Google play store and then uninstall him, we could show him who's boss
