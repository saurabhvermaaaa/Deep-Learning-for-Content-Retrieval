BSF dismisses jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav who complained of 'sub-standard' food

NEW DELHI: The Border Security Force has dismissed the jawan who had complained about the sub-standard food being served to the jawans.
Officials said Tej Bahadur Yadav was sacked by the border guarding force on the basis of a report of a staff court of inquiry (SCoI).
The inquiry, they said, found the constable-rank jawan guilty of making false charges.
"The action of dismissal of the jawan has been taken under the Border Security Force Act that is applicable to all the personnel serving in the paramilitary force," a senior officer said.
"Yadav has been found guilty on certain charges of indiscipline including uploading the said video in violation of laid down procedures and rules. He has an option to appeal against the verdict within three months time," he added.
Yadav had created a storm earlier this year by posting videos on social media showing that jawans posted on the border were being served low quality food, which BSF had denied

Pursuant to the video going viral on social media, the Prime Minister's Office had sought a detailed factual report+ on it from the Union home ministry and BSF.
A PIL was also filed in the Delhi high court seeking a direction to the government to depute higher officers to supervise cooking of proper healthy food and its distribution. It sought a status report regarding the quality of food served to soldiers along the LoC.

The high court had issued notice on the petition to various paramilitary forces, including the Border Security Force (BSF), seeking their stand on the allegation of poor quality food being served to the troops.
It had also directed BSF to produce before it the investigation report and the steps taken with regard to the allegations levelled by the BSF jawan.
