Srinagar: In view of a number of videos showing security personnel in bad light circulating on social media sites, the Jammu and Kashmir police has directed telecom companies to shut their 3G and 4G internet services in the Kashmir Valley.

Several videos surfaced in recent days in the Valley which showed atrocities by Army, police, CRPF or other para-military forces deputed for Parliamentary by-elections in Srinagar.

Sources said it appears that such videos were being circulated with an aim to create fear among people or show the security personnel in poor light.

There is a huge controversy over a video showing a man tied to an army jeep in Budgam district of central Kashmir on April 9. This alleged act was widely criticized. A case has been registered against unknown army personnel.
