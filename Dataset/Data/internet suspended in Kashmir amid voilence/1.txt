SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir police has directed telecom companies to shut their 3G and 4G services in the Kashmir Valley as the state authorities feel there has been an attempt to spread fear and show security personnel in a bad light through online videos, official sources said.
The decision was taken after several videos surfaced in recent days, some showing local politicians being threatened by terrorists in various parts of the Valley and others which showed alleged atrocities by Army, police, CRPF or other para-military forces deputed for Parliamentary bye-elections.
Officials said that it appears that such videos were being circulated with an aim to create fear among people or show the security personnel in poor light.
Controversy peaked when a video showing a man tied to an army jeep in Budgam district of central Kashmir on April 9 surfaced when polling was underway for the Srinagar Parliamentary bypoll.
A case has been registered against unknown army personnel for the alleged act which received wide criticism.There were videos showing traders and political leaders in Pulwama of South Kashmir being threatened by terrorists at gun point.
"Such videos are only aimed at creating scare in general public," a senior police official said.
In view of the sensitive Srinagar bypoll, internet services had been suspended in the Valley and were restored on April 13.
